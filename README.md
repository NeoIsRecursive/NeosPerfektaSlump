## about

A webapplication for creating groups and assigning random students questions fairly.
It was made as a gymnasiearbete project and has some neat features.

### features:
* Random student from list, fairly!
* Assigning random groups, just say how many!
* Exporting created groups
    * By file
    * Copy all groups
    * Copy individual groups
* Reading files

as you can see in the code it is currently limited to .csv files since they are always formated
the same.
