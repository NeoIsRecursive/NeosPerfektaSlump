## about

A webapplication for creating groups and assigning random students questions fairly.<br>
It was made as a gymnasiearbete project and has some neat features.

### features:
* Get random student from list, fairly!
* Assigning random groups, just say how many!
* Exporting created groups:
    1. Download all groups to .txt.
    2. Copy all groups.
    3. Copy individual groups.
* Reading files.
* Upload files.
* Get uploaded files.

As you can see in the code it is currently limited to .csv files since they are always formated
the same.

TODO
- [x] make responsive
- [ ] make so copy to clipboard tells user it copied 
- [ ] new icon/logo for the project?

### do

groups should also be fair, possible by computing all possible unique group combos and choosing one at random, like the answeree is computed?
answered should sustain so maybe localstorage, yeah probarbly.
sustain when logging in on other computer?????
